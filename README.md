# OXFEDE::GPUKit

A framework for implementing reconfigurable rendering pipelines in C++ / OpenGL

The framework exposes OpenGL functionality thru an object oriented interface. It's still work in progress but supports the following constructs so far:

- **vertex, geometry and fragment shaders** (including the ability to parse text files into these objects.)
- **programs**, which expose vertex inputs / outputs thru a parameterized interface.
- **buffers**, which expose texture target binding for shader output.
- **2D and 3D (Cubemap) textures.**
- **geometry.**

The framework also has a couple higher level constructs:
- **Passes:** a way to organize the rendering code associated with a program / buffer combination.
- **Material:** a way to proxy a program's attributes (shader uniforms) so the program can be shared among different geometry.

## Dependencies: 
- [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) for GL context / window creation.
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for linear algebra constructs (i.e. vec3, mat4).
- [glew](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) if your system does not otherwise expose a GL 4.1 or greater API.

## How to use it:
0. Make sure you have the above dependencies.
1. Include the whole GPUKit source folder in your project, or build it into a library and link against that.
2. Include `GPUKit.h` in your code. 
3. Make sure to call `GPUKit::init` before using anything else from the API.
4. Use the framework.
5. Make sure to call `GPUKit::shutdown` when you are done and want to tear down the OpenGL context and window.

## Example:

There is an example folder that uses the framework to render the following [scene](http://0xfede.io/index.php/project/gpukit/). It comes with 3d models as well as all passes and shaders for a deferred pipeline including dynamic point shadows and bloom.

Please note that the example uses [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) to parse fbx / obj files into geometry objects. You'll need that lib too if you want to use the project as is.
